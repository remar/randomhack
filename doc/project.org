** Look up
*** TODO Look up mock frameworks for FlexUnit
** Bugs
*** DONE Enemy array isn't cleared when generating a new level
*** DONE There should only be 8 item slots (and 9 console lines)
*** DONE Enemies shouldn't start on top of player or goal
    Fixed by filtering out positions that are close to player or
    goal.
** Refactorings
*** DONE Push up moveRelative from Player and Enemy to GameObject
*** DONE Push up checking for obstacles when moving to GameObject
*** DONE Create class CreatureController, move methods from Level to it
*** DONE Add getters and setters for Point x and y
*** DONE Field.getTile should take a Point instead of x and y
*** DONE Field.setTile should take a Point instead of x and y
*** TODO Convert the enums to stronger typed ones

     See http://scottbilas.com/blog/ultimate-as3-fake-enums/ for code.
**** TODO Convert SpriteType to new enum style
**** TODO Convert TileType to new enum style
*** TODO Player and Enemy should have superclass Creature
** Level
*** TODO Listen for "start button" (whatever that is)
*** DONE Check if player is dead
*** DONE Print out starting message
    Will do this as part of a startGame method.
** Field
*** DONE Get a randomized list of empty tile positions
*** TODO Better distance between player start and goal
*** TODO Tile rendering
    Should randomly make jagged edges in cave levels.

*** DONE HP / max HP

*** TODO Talking

** Items

     Kind of special. Can only carry one sword. No other kinds of
     weapons are available (except bare hands).
*** TODO Stick
*** TODO Torch
*** TODO Rubble
*** TODO Bottle
** General enemy stuff
*** DONE Enemy name
*** TODO Enemy prefix (and additional modifications)
*** DONE Keep track of hp and max hp
*** DONE Movement
    Right now an enemy moves every time that it is its turn, but
    originally it only moves if it's lucky (d10 <= speed).
*** TODO Should get list of available spots and select one randomly when moving
*** DONE Attacking
**** DONE Add accuracy
**** DONE Add power
*** DONE Print to the console when attacking
*** TODO Line of sight
** Enemies
*** DONE Array of enemies in Level
*** TODO Enemy factory

** Info screen
   In the original, all info and items where displayed as text in a
   console view. This should be made more general so that how the
   information is displayed can be changed at a later point. I'll
   implement a console anyway to display the stuff, to make this
   reimplementation look just like the "old school" original.
*** DONE Keep track of status
    Some kind of object that keeps track of status that should be
    displayed. HP/maxHP, inventory, power, gold, level, hiscore,
    poison, burn, weapon, player prefix and name, console strings.
*** TODO Keep track of and display poison and burn
*** DONE InfoView interface
    Interface for views that display information in a ScoreKeeper
    object.
*** DONE ConsoleInfoView
    And InfoView that displays the info as text in a console. Done for
    now means that it's started.
*** DONE Flesh out ConsoleInfoView to look like original
*** DONE Add scrolling to Console and ConsoleInfoView
*** DONE Console
**** DONE Simple font engine
     Use sprite graphics factory to provide characters.
