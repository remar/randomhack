** TODO Field
*** TODO Tile rendering
    Should randomly make jagged edges in cave levels.
*** TODO Ruins
** TODO Player
*** TODO Attacking
*** TODO Talking
*** TODO Picking up stuff
*** TODO Dropping stuff
** TODO Items
*** TODO Sword
    Kind of special. Can only carry one sword. No other weapons are
    available.
*** TODO Stick
*** TODO Torch
*** TODO Rubble
*** TODO Bottle
** TODO General enemy stuff
*** DONE Movement
    Right now an enemy moves every time that it is its turn, but
    originally it only moves if it's lucky (d10 <= speed).
*** TODO Attacking
*** TODO Line of sight
** TODO Enemies
*** TODO Bat
** TODO Info screen
   In the original, all info and items where displayed as text in a
   console view. This should be made more general so that how the
   information is displayed can be changed at a later point. I'll
   implement a console anyway to display the stuff, to make this
   reimplementation look just like the "old school" original.
