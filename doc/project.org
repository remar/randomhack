** Info screen
   In the original, all info and items where displayed as text in a
   console view. This should be made more general so that how the
   information is displayed can be changed at a later point. I'll
   implement a console anyway to display the stuff, to make this
   reimplementation look just like the "old school" original.
*** DONE Keep track of status
    Some kind of object that keeps track of status that should be
    displayed. HP/maxHP, inventory, power, gold, level, hiscore,
    poison, burn, weapon, player prefix and name, console strings.
*** TODO Keep track of and display poison and burn
*** DONE InfoView interface
    Interface for views that display information in a ScoreKeeper
    object.
*** DONE ConsoleInfoView
    And InfoView that displays the info as text in a console. Done for
    now means that it's started.
*** DONE Flesh out ConsoleInfoView to look like original
*** TODO Add scrolling to Console and ConsoleInfoView
*** DONE Console
**** DONE Simple font engine
     Use sprite graphics factory to provide characters.
