InputHandler interface. Make a RecordingInputHandler (and
RecordingNumberGenerator) to make a "demo" mode.

Priority for drawables (e.g. to draw Player over Items).

Class hierarchy for game objects:

. GameObject
Base class for objects in the game. Provides methods for updating the
objects state (update()), for setting and getting its position, and
for drawing the object in a Drawable.

. Enemy
Needs to know about the playing field, player position, and other
creatures to be able to perform move and attack. Probably provide
these in the update method. Or... have one attack method and one move
method, because that's how it works in the original code. So first,
all enemies attack, and then all enemies move. To perform attack, only
player position has to be known. To perform move, we need to know
about the other stuff as well.
