* Randomhack
** Introduction
   Randhomhack is a simple dungeoncrawler with a point'n'click
   interface. It was originally implemented for the Nintendo DS, with
   only primitive pixel by pixel drawing. This is a complete
   reimplementation of that game in ActionScript 3.
** Disclaimer
   As the game is under development, much of what is said here isn't
   implemented yet.
** Controls
   The game will be controlled with the mouse. Click on the playing
   field to move the player or attack a creature in that
   direction. Shortcut keys will also be available.
